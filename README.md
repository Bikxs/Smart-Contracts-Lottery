# Smart Contracts Lottery
Application for running a lottery in the ethereum block chain

## How it works
1. Users enter the lottery with ETH based on a USD fee
2. An admin will choose when the lotter is over
3. The lottery will select a random winner

## Testing Strategy
1. 'development' with mocks - unit tests
2. 'testnet' - integration testing
3. 'mainnet-fork' - end to end testing
